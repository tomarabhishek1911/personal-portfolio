            I'm Abhishek Singh Tomar, a passionate Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate at Lovely Professional University. I specialize in full-stack web development using the MERN stack, with a strong focus on building scalable, responsive, and user-centric applications. I enjoy transforming ideas into working digital solutionsâ€”from laundry service platforms with real-time scheduling to interactive blogging and game-based web apps.

Alongside academic learning, I've actively honed my coding skills by solving over 500 problems on LeetCode, earning multiple stars on HackerRank, and completing industry-relevant certifications, including Python and cloud computing. I'm always eager to learn, adapt, and collaborate, whether it's leading a team project or diving deep into backend logic and frontend polish.

With a solid foundation in programming languages like C++, Python, and JavaScript, and a creative problem-solving mindset, I strive to grow as a developer who not only writes code but builds meaningful user experiences.
